Verb Endings

The verb endings in Ido are:

-ar present infinitive, -ir past infinitive, -or future infinitive

-as present tense, -is past tense, -os future tense

-us conditional present tense

-ez imperative

-ab- suffix used in conjunction with past, future and conditional endings to form perfect tenses (eg. had gone, will have gone, would have gone). In 1947 it was decided that -ab- may also be used with the present to form a perfect tense: me vidabas - I have seen.

-ant- present active participle: eg. seeing
-int- past active participle: eg. having seen
-ont- future active participle: eg. going to see
-at- present passive participle: eg. being seen
-it- past passive participle: eg. having been seen
-ot- future active participle: eg. going to be seen

The participles are most commonly found with the adjective ending -a, but also sometimes with -e (adverb) or -o/-i (noun).

Grammatical Endings

The endings indicating parts of speech are:

-o singular noun
-i plural noun
-a adjective
-e adverb

in addition to the verb endings above.

Direct Derivation

These are the four methods of direct derivation in Ido:

Verb to noun: By replacing the -ar of an infinitive with -o, we form the noun meaning the simple action or state implied by the verb: brosar - to brush, broso - a brushing. The continuous or frequent action is indicated by -ad-: brosado - brushing.

Adjective to noun: By replacing the -a of an adjective with -o, we form the person or thing having that property: bona - good, bono - good one, good man.

Noun to adjective: By replacing the -o of a noun with -a, we describe something as made of the substance indicated by the noun: oro - gold, ora - made of gold.

Adjective to adverb: By replacing the -a of an adjective with an -e, we describe something as happening in the manner indicated by the adjective: bela - beautiful, bele - beautifully.

"Correlatives"

The following table gives the "correlatives" that exist in Ido. It should be read first along the top, then down the left, eg. what place=where=ube.


	WHAT 	THAT 	SOME 	ANY 	NO 	EVERY
PERSON 	qua/i 	(i)ta/i 	ulu/i 	irgu/i 	nulu/i 	omnu/i
THING 	quo/i 	(i)to/i 	ulo/i 	irgo/i 	nulo/i 	omno/i
PLACE 	ube 	ibe 	ulaloke 	irgaloke 	nulaloke 	omnaloke
TIME 	kande 	lore 	ulatempe 	irgatempe 	nulatempe 	sempre
WAY 	quale 	tale 	ule 	irge 	nule 	omne
QUANTITY 	quanto 	tanto 	ulaquanto 	irgaquanto 	nulaquanto 	omnaquanto

Please note:

    The to/ito forms etc. are intended to aid euphony, so that to is generally used after a vowel, and ito after a consonant. Similarly for co/ico.
    For lore, ube etc. it is perfectly permissible to use the regularly formed tatempe, qualoke, but mostly the more natural and convenient forms are preferred.
    Esperantists should note that the equivalents of their remaining "correlatives" may be formed more in accordance with national languages, eg. qua sorto de ... ? (or quala ?) = "what sort of ... ?".
    It is permissible to drop the adjectival -a in words such as "nulatempe" where euphony permits.
    A hyphen may be inserted between the adjectival prefix and the substantival suffix in words such as ultempe = ulatempe = ul-tempe = ula-tempe, in order to more clearly distinguish the two formative elements of the word.

Comparison

Adjectives and adverbs are compared in Ido by means of the words plu = more, maxim = most, min = less, minim = least.
